# Motivation

A code challenge I came up with while walking around Fountain Painted Pots in Yellowstone after reading Mark McGrath's Python InEasySteps book.

[Live Deployment](https://img-locator-jswu2gydnq-uc.a.run.app/)

## Setup

Use poetry to control package versions

Deploy to Cloud Run using the `./Projectfile deploy` command. Change this to your own GCP Project.

Google API Key required for `Maps Embed API`

## Local Development

Use dotenv to handle your Google API Key secret.

Run `./Projectfile images` to build locally

Run `./Projectfile shell` to get a shell inside the container

While in the shell, run `./bin/run_server` to start up local dev w/ automatic uvicorn reload.

## To-Do

Unit-tests
